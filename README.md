# KaggleProject

1- Business objectives

The project we have undertaken aims to study in depth the impact that our social environment has on educational outcomes, and ultimately, on our professional future. 
This issue is of crucial importance for our society as it directly affects equal opportunities and social justice.

Indeed, it is well known that social inequalities have a significant impact on educational success. Pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds often have less access to educational resources and opportunities than pupils from privileged backgrounds. They may also face social and emotional challenges that can affect their academic performance.

Our goal here is to improve students' professional futures by giving them the tools they need to succeed in school and in their professional lives. 

We will focus only on attributes related to the student's home environment and will not consider factors related to students' intrinsic behaviour.

The questions that emerge from this objective and that we will answer are multiple:

-What are the main causes of underachievement among students?
-Do students from different social backgrounds experience the same academic difficulties and are they affected in the same way by their social environment?
-What are the common features of successful students (the "MAJOR") and unsuccessful students (the "MINOR")? (Make a typical profile of the successful student (the MAJOR) and the unsuccessful one (the MINOR))
-What is the sector of employment of parents that most affects underachieving students?
-Finally, is there a real link between success and social environment or is it not true? 


The table we will use to relate academic achievement to social background is as follows, since we want to focus on the family background of the student and will not take into account factors related to the internal behaviour of students.


2 - Technical goal

In order to study this business goal in depth we will use several techniques:

Multiple regression: This technique will allow us to establish a linear relationship between a dependent variable and several independent variables. This will allow us to determine more precisely the impact of different variables on the academic success of students.

Logistic regression: Finally, we will study a logistic regression to model the probability of a binary event as a function of explanatory variables.
This will allow us to determine the probability of a student passing or failing as a function of their social environment and other relevant variables.

In each technique, we will use visualisation tools to graphically represent the results and conclusions of our analysis. 
Multiple regressions as scatter plots and logistic regressions as ROC curves or confusion matrices.
